# âš  Warnings

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful when you set the rewards. Some communities are more prone to alt accounts, so don't give out important permissions.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When setting the rewards, make sure the bot's role is **above** the rewarded roles in the server's role list. Otherwise the bot will not be able to give them out.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When you set or update rewards, the changes are not directly applied to your server's members. However, when a member uses the `/check-reputation` command, they are recalculated.
{% endhint %}
